## Interests

I am a huge gamer, playing a wide variety of games including FPS like destiny to puzzle games like Professor Layton. My favourite type would be logic/puzzle games as they make you think in different ways to find the answer.

I am also a big fan of construction toys like LEGO and wooden models. I love to get given parts to a model or a construct and instructions on how to create it and just build it.
